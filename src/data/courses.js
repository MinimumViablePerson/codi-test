  - A heading with name of the bird species
  - An image of that bird
  - A description paragraph with some info about the species

Birdify would like you to make the following changes to their site:

- Add a bit more structure by having a a header, a main section and a footer section
- Add an About Us page: about.html
- The header section should have a nav bar, and it should have a link to both the home page and the about us page
- Both pages should have the same header and footer
- The about page should have:
  - A main title of About Us
  - A nice picture
  - A paragraph describing birdwatching

_Note: If you are not sure about how to use the new semantic elements that were introduced,  you can take a look a the Semantic Elements page on MDN (Links to an external site.) to learn more about them and see some examples._`

        content: `Welcome to your first ever project! Projects are chunkier assignments, where you will usually have to do things from the ground up rather than starting with a template. They are a great way to practice and consolidate what you've been learning throughout the day.

Once you submit your project, it will be reviewed by one of your peers, and you'll get to review one of your peer's work, too!

This is great for two reasons:

- Being a good developer is as much about reading and understanding others' code than about writing your own. Getting experience in this area is an advantage that will already place you above most beginners.
- Collaboration and code reviews are the bread and butter of any development team, and getting experience in this area as soon as possible will give you the tools you need to stand out in an interview and to hit the ground running when you land your first job!
Alright, let's get started!

## Intro
For this project, you are becoming an entrepreneur for a day. You are going to build a website for your brand new business.

Come up with a name, a product, and be sure to let everyone know clearly what you are about!

## The least you should do
These are the key points that you need to complete in order to call your project a success, but you are encouraged to go express yourself, go beyond the limits and have fun exploring once you've met these minimum requirements.

- Have a header with a logo and a navigation bar
- Have a footer, also with a navigation bar
- Have at least 4 pages, and your nav bar should give users access to each of them
- Every page should have the same header and footer
- Use at least 4 pictures in your home page, and at least 1 picture in each other page
- Make use of every element we talked about in the lecture notes:
  - paragraph
  - bold
  - italics
  - headings (at least h1 and h2)
  - ordered list
  - unordered list
  - image
  - div
  - comments!
- Use at least 1 element we haven't covered. Look at the [MDN Elements page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) for inspiration

*   Add a "password" **placeholder** to the password field
*   Add a **non-nested label** to the terms and conditions checkbox that reads: "I agree with the terms and conditions."

As a refresher, here's what we mean by nested and non-nested labels:

**Nested label**: The input and the label are linked by placing the input element inside of the label element.

**Non-nested label**: The input should not be inside the label element. Instead, it should be linked to the input using the **for** and **id** attributes.

If you are struggling with this part, rewatch the video or head over to the **MDN** page for **labels**!`

So, Birdify are now asking you to make things a little stricter:

For the contact form:

*   Make sure the **name** is **not empty** and that it has **at least 2 characters**, but **no more than 30 characters**
*   Make sure the **email** is **not empty** and that it is a **valid email**
*   Make sure the **message** is **not empty** and is has **at least 10 characters in it**

For the spotted form:

*   Make sure the **species name** is **not empty** and that it has **at least 2 characters**, but **no more than 30 characters**
*   Make sure the **image** is **not empty** and that it has **at least 10 characters**
*   Make sure the **description** is **not empty** and is has **at least 30 characters in it**`

*   The **borders** of all the **inputs** should be **solid**, with a **thickness of 1px** and also with the color **#ca4128**
*   The **footer** should have: a **#555555 background,** a **#ffffff font** and **centered text**
*   Finally, all **bird cards** should have:
    *   A **border** that's **solid 1px #ca412850** and has the **edges rounded 5px**
    *   A **side padding** of **20px**
    *   A **top and bottom margin** of **20px**

Intro
-----

For this project, if you could call it that, I'd like you to grab the business site you built during the [mark up section](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2263648/assignments/17008067) and spice it up by adding forms and styling.

The least you should do
-----------------------

Let's keep the requirements to a minimum here to give your creativity plenty of room to work with!

*   Add at least 2 forms
*   Change font types of at least one element
*   Change font color of at least 2 elements
*   Add padding somewhere
*   Add margin somewhere

That's it!

Note: Fork your CodeSanbox before you get started (file > fork), so you don't lose the first project, and don't forget to submit the URL once you're done!`

They would therefore like you to make the side menu disappear whenever they are using a small screen.

When the screen size is 600px or lower:

*   Change the grid template to a **1x3 grid**, getting rid of the side menu
*   Set the side menu's **display** to **none**, to be sure it doesn't show up

Note: There is no test to pass in this lab, but you will know when you got it because the menu should disappear when you shrink the screen and reappear when you enlarge it.`
